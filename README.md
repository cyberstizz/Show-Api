#             **QuickShow**

## This is a React project

### this project includes
* React
* Axios


### Synopsis
this is probably the first React project that I ever created. It uses Axios for api calls.


### How it works
Simple, there is a search bar in the center of the screen. type the name of the show into the search bar and if the show is in our database(which it most likely is), the results will be displayed on the screen.

the results will be:
1. when the show first aired
2. what network the show appeared on
3. if the show is still running

there will also be art from the show displayed in the center of the screen(if available)


### Biggest challenges
funny enough, back in 2020 when I first created this application, I could not get it to work for days. the reason it did not work is because I was trying to use http instead of https for my api calls. so as always I learned something valuable.


### Code Review
this project uses very basic code, but one thing that I find very cool, is the fact that it still uses the old class based React components. awesome and archaic!!

### final thought
I learned a bit about networking from this project, and as a result I keep it to remind me of the four days or so I spent beating my head against the wall all over a simnple mistake.
