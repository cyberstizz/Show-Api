Name of application: QuickShow

Audience: anyone who loves watching shows or Netflix

Why I am creating this:
for anyone that wants a quick update about a show they are interested in, that loads fast and easy without complication

Mission Statement:
the goal is to create a website that will allow users to quickly look up show information like when it first aired and if it is still in progress. There will be a user form where users can enter the name of a show and hit submit to get the information back for their query.

this project will use the episodate api. It will be a one page application that uses transitions to bring in returned search results.

New technologies: The new technology I will use for this project will be Sass and Redux.

synopsis: This app will give the user access to information about shows quickly.
-upon entering the website users are greeted with a menu and a search bar
-if a search is entered, the website will return the results with show information
-if a user wants additional information, they can click more info and a popup will display more information.

-the data will transition at the bottom section of the page via a fade effect.
